# Jan 17: Intro and Monty Hall

This week is about getting to know the course and what to expect. We'll start by diving into
a wild exercise: solving the classic Monty Hall problem using our own
simulation in `R`. We will also take our first glance at literate
programming: using `R markdown` to code and typeset in one document. 
Yes, we’ll cover the syllabus and spend a bit of time getting to know everyone. 

## Preparation

- Install and configure the software we need for the course. See the
  [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/SIS-data-analysis/00-getting-started)
  for detail and instructions.  
- If you want to build or refresh your basic R skills, work through the
  sample exercises in the [Survival
  Guide](https://austin-hart-pols.github.io/SurvivalGuide/) or Chapters
  2 or 5 of [Dr. Bryan’s Stat 545 text](https://stat545.com/). Get used
  to typing and executing commands, loading packages, etc. Compare your
  output with that given in the texts.
